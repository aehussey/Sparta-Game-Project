## How To Play

Cravate is a 2 player game of solitaire, based on luck and skill. It is a slow game, that requires patience.

The aim of the game is for each player to get rid of all of their cards. The 1st player to do so wins.

A player can get rid of their cards in two ways. The player turns over cards from their deck and can play the card on either the outside or central piles

A card can be played on the outer pile if said card is lower by one and a different colour to the top card on the outer pile.

The first card played on the central pile must me an ace. The 1st central pile to have an ace in it must be the top left. The nest is the top right and then the order follows this down into the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rows.

Once a card has been placed IT CANNOT BE MOVED.

If you try to turn a card over and nothing happens, it is time to click 'End Turn' - Your Turn is over
